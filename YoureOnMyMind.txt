And as the sun goes down
And the stars come out to play
I bet tomorrow I’ll be sleeping
I’ll be sleeping all day
And this fire I feel
Why is it burning so slowly?
I can’t stop thinking of you
Like the five pounds you owe me
Cos you’re on my mind
Cos you’re on my mind
You’re all I can find
Cos you’re on my mind
Please tell me that you feel the same
That we're on the same train
If you're a little bit late and miss it
That would be a great shame
I miss your sweet, sweet kisses and lovin’
When they were mine
When are you down?
Make sure I’m in town
Cos you’re on my mind
Cos you’re on my mind
You’re all I can find
Cos you’re on my mind
Cos you’re on my mind
Cos you’re on my mind
You’re all I can find
Cos you’re on my mind
All the colours they shine through
Night time, and I’m thinking of you
Each storm of every day
You’re on my mind
Cos you’re on my mind
Cos you’re on my mind
You’re all I can find
Cos you’re on my mind
Cos you’re on my mind
Cos you’re on my mind
You’re all I can find
Cos you’re on my mind
