HiP CoLouR

I’ve, Been poking you (I poked you once…)
I’m poking you again

I’m poking you till you become my friend

Since last we spoke I just can’t rest my feet
I’m poking you ’till you decide to meet (I’m poking you until you wanna meet)

But your response…
Waiting to hear…
What are you up to?..
No need to fear…

I am waiting here until you see that I am opening my heart

And when I get to look into your face
My heart starts to expand to outer space
More beautiful than all the stars combined 
A hundred thousand billion trillion times

You poked me back.
