Bounce around for me
Bounce around for me
Bounce around for me
Oo, oo

I’ll bounce around for you
I’ll bounce around for you
I’ll bounce around for you
Oo, oo

[Verse 1: The Trp]
You make my heart go
You make my heart sing
Sometimes, I think to myself
Why, why
You cosplay do it well
Oh I, feel like hentai-llucination

Watching movies, building list together
It be getting so long we’ll probably skip Paprika
Melting down that flame, to the wick, Odessa
Got a nut in chains and you wish to severe

Ooo got your bondage kit now
I just know you in bound
Can’t wait till you back in town
So I can tie you in down

And I can whip that a-s-s
And I can heal all of your stress
You swinging, giving that head
And clawing my back so red

You check my bruises it’s cool
I don’t care about that, it’s cool
I know I needed that shit
That saslinephoto a kiss
We’ll probably cradle and soothe
Cause we both want feel used

You popping Zoloft
That’s tonight, fuck it
Turned our phone off
Don’t need that screen when I’m high with you

They slide in ur dms
While I’m sliding off your panties loose
That entire coat, they ain’t no, no king or queen
Swim in a Nile of gold

So go head lucid dream
Cause I might just show up
For the seconds, oh what you reckon

Oh I woke, I do myself
I know you well
You know me well

So

Oo you know me well

And my pride, it be wasting my time
I’ll set that aside, cause I’m needing your vibe
I been losing my shit, are we moving too quick

[Chorus 2: The Trp]
Oh damn, would you do this for me
Oh damn, what you doing to me
Oh damn, Ima see you
Oh mam, you the coolest

Your ass so foxy baby now got me
Ooo and I want you baby now want me
So relax out on that tail
Hitachi
Hitachi
Hitachi

We are fine
We dream sometimes
I need some time

I just wanna make you mine

Collar leather collar
We just try to start up
We should switch to palms
Make these parts, little hotter

Glowing by the shore
Pearls are getting taller
Mining all these stars
Babe you’re needed on that water
What up

And what up
How you doing?
Hey what up, ooo how you doing
What up
